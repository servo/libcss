Parser testcases
================

Format
------

#data
<css source data>
#errors
<list of expected errors, with line/col offsets> (ignored at present)
#expected
<rule list, as below>
#reset

Format of rule list
-------------------

  line     ::= rule | bytecode
  rule     ::= '| ' type ' '+ name
  name     ::= .+
  type     ::= [0-9]+
  bytecode ::= '|  ' ' '* hexnum (' '+ hexnum)*
  hexnum   ::= '0x' [0-9a-fA-F]+

Type corresponds to css_rule_type. Consult the library sources for the values.

Bytecode may be split over multiple lines for readability. All bytecode is
associated with the most-recently-declared rule.

Example
-------

#data
* { color: #ff0000 }
#errors
#expected
| 1 *
|   0x0200000f 0xff000000
#reset

TODO
----

  + Permit nesting of rules (for nested block support)
  + There's no way of flagging a pointer in the bytecode (ideally, this will
    be defined in such a way that we'll be able to validate the data pointed
    to, too)
